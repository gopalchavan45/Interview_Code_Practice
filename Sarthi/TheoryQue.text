1.What is the difference between slice and splice method
-> slice method which is used to extract the element from original array as we specify index such as o ,4 but in that it will not consider last one which we specify , it will give new array without changing the original array
or
splice also consider for to extact or delelte element but It will mute the original array as we specify index such as 0,4 here element at 4 also delete
