1.when interviewer ask question take some seconds instead of doing um,aa this type of stuff ,this are the stuff are very onaging to interviewer as well as impact on interviewer

so while answering take some pauses instead of doing um,aa etc.
if you do not, say no in polite way it always makes impact or respect to interviewer instead of reply rude...stay calm ,composed and respect full.
